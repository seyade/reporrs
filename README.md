# REPORRS

## Create your progress reports

Built with React, GraphQL, Apollo, Docker, Node and MongoDB.

Don't forget to add `data/db` somewhere for `docker` servicing `mongodb`.

To start the app you have run 2 commands. You can use `npm` or `yarn`. For data service, go in `reporrs/reports-service` with the command line, then do

```
npm run watch
```

And run the UI, go in `client` then do:

```
npm start
```

In the future, I'll use `concurrently` or something similar to run the app at once.
